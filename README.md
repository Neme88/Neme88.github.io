About Us:
Fitraka was founded on a genuine love for fitness and a commitment to enhancing the health of individuals and communities. This fitness tracking application represents the conclusion of a personal voyage towards a healthier way of life.

Project Motivation:
Fitraka was not conceived out of academic necessity, but rather a sincere desire to make fitness accessible and enjoyable. It was the result of numerous early morning workouts, tranquil runs along scenic trails, and the camaraderie fostered in group fitness classes. It reflects an individual's journey towards a healthier lifestyle.

Timeline:
The process of developing Fitraka was both difficult and rewarding. Countless hours were spent on research, coding, and testing to bring this vision to life. The timeline reflects the commitment to create something meaningful, which is motivated by a genuine desire to have a positive impact.

Portfolio Effort:
This landing page and the Fitraka fitness monitoring application are components of my Holberton School Portfolio Project. In addition to satisfying an academic requirement, it is an opportunity to transform a personal interest into a tangible instrument for bettering people's lives.
