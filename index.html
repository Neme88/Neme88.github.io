    <!-- About Us Section -->
    <section id="about" style="margin-left: 5%;">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time, during my time at Holberton School, the concept for my fitness monitoring application, Fitraka, took shape. But let me be clear: this endeavour was not born out of academic necessity; it was forged out of a deep-seated passion for fitness and a sincere desire to positively affect people's lives.</p>
        <p>Fitraka was inspired by the numerous early mornings and late evenings I spent in the gym, jogging along scenic trails, and attending group fitness classes. It is a reflection of my personal journey towards a healthier lifestyle, as well as the realisation that many others have similar goals.</p>
        <p>As I delved deeper into the realm of fitness, I encountered the difficulties and roadblocks that frequently accompany the pursuit of a healthful lifestyle. Keeping track of workouts, monitoring progress, and establishing attainable objectives can be challenging duties. Here, Fitraka comes into play.</p>
        <p>Fitraka is not merely a project; it is a labour of passion intended to make fitness accessible and enjoyable for all. It involves assisting people, regardless of their fitness level, to embark on their own transformative journeys. This project's timeline reflects innumerable hours of research, coding, and testing, which were motivated not by academic requirements but by my unwavering desire to create something meaningful.</p>        <p>This Portfolio Project for Holberton School is more than a requirement; it's a chance for me to realise my individual vision. It is an opportunity to reconcile the divide between technology and health, empowering individuals to take charge of their health and fitness. It serves as a reminder that every line of code, feature, and design decision is motivated by my sincere desire to have a positive impact.</p>
        <p>As you explore Fitraka, keep in mind that it is not simply an app. It is a testament to the power of individual dedication and devotion. It reflects the values that motivate me to make the world healthier and happier, one workout at a time.</p>
        <p>Thank you for travelling along with me.</p>
